# 0.4.1 (17 August 2018)

* Reverts the removal of Re.marks.
  This fixes various bugs in the previous version.

# 0.4 (06 August 2018)

* Move to dune
* Remove the need for Re.marks. 
  This might open the way to alterative backends, such as JS regexs.
  See https://github.com/Drup/tyre/issues/1 for details.
* Use Seq instead of Gen. This is a breaking change.

# 0.3 (17 April 2017)

* Performance improvements.
* Fix the behavior of opt (Prefer eating input).
* Remove conv_fail and allow usual converters to fail with an exception.
* Add Tyre.all and Tyre.all_gen

# 0.2 (08 October 2016)
* Rename `<?>` to `<|>`
* Rename `<*>` to `<&>`
* Add the `str` and `char` combinators for constant patterns.
* Add the `blank` combinator.
* Add an Infix module.
* `Tyre.conv` is now separated into two combinators, `conv` which doesn't use
  an option, but is not allowed to fail, and `conv_fail` which allows failures.
* The prefix (`<*`) and suffix (`*>`) operators now accepts tyregexs on both
  sides. The old behavior can be recovered by combining with `Tyre.str`.
  This makes prefixstr/suffixstr (`**>`/`<**`) redundant, they are removed.
* The various list combinators now accept a tyregex as separator.
  The old behavior can be recovered by combining with `Tyre.str`.
* Add the `start` and `stop` combinators.
* The ~whole argument for compile and route is removed.
  tyregex don't match the whole string by default anymore.
  You can use `Tyre.whole_string` or `Tyre.start` and `Tyre.stop` instead.

# 0.1.1 (09 September 2016)
* Fix a bug with nested repetitions. Also avoid some copying of the original string.
* Add Tyre.execp
